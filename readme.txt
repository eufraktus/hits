Holofractal Interactive Transduction of Sound HITS
Free open source system for live interactive multimedia performances
Developed by euFraktus_X a.k.a. Eufrasio Prates, PhD in Arts and Technology

This is the alpha version of a suite of max-msp patches created to aid multimedia performances using movements in front of the webcam to trigger fractal sounds (and lisergic visuals) in real time. Some of the patches were made with parts from other patches found online and the due credit is given in the main window of each patch interface.

No warranties offered, of course.
